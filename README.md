# Dynatrace-CAS-Application-Load-Plugin
Plugin that uses DCRUM REST API to compare the amount of operations of each configured application.  The plugin compares the amount of operation from today, starting at midnight, with the same period last week. A spreadsheet is built and sent by e-mail along with a summary of the compared data.
